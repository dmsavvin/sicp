### Exercise 1.34

Suppose we define the procedure
```
(define (f g) (g 2))
```
Then we have
```
(f square)
4
(f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1))))
6
```
What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to evaluate the combination `(f f)`? Explain.

### Solution

Using substitution model we can reason as follows  `(f f)` --> `(f 2)` --> `(2 2)` which causes an error since interpreter gets `2` instead of some procedure.
