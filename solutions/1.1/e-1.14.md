### Exercise 1.14

Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the count-change procedure of Section 1.2.2 in making change for 11 cents. What are the orders of growth of the space and number of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed increases?

### Solution

Lets denote the event of calling the count-change procedure as C(amount, [list of available coins]). Then the process of calling C(6, [1]) will look like:

    C(6, [1]) -- C(5, [1]) -- C(4, [1]) -- C(3, [1]) -- C(2, [1]) -- C(1, [1]) -- C(0, [1])
        |            |            |            |            |            |
     C(6, [ ])    C(6, [ ])    C(6, [ ])    C(6, [ ])    C(6, [ ])    C(6, [ ])

If we denote $S_l(n)$ space requirement for the procedure C(n, [length of l]) and $T_l(n)$ time requirement for the same procedure then we can conclude that $S_1(n)$ and $T_1(n)$ are both $\Omicron(n)$ functions.

Now lets consider the process of calling C(20, [5, 1]):

    C(20, [5, 1]) -- C(15, [5, 1]) -- C(10, [5, 1]) -- C(5, [5, 1]) -- C(0, [5, 1])
    |                |                |                |
    C(20, [1])       C(15, [1])       C(10, [1])       C(5, [1])

Here we have chain of calls of C(x, [5, 1]) where x diminishes from 20 to 0 with the step -5. Each (last one excluded) of the C(x, [5, 1]) calls generates not only call of C(x-5, [5, 1]) but also call of C(x, [1]). Obviously amount of C(n, [5, 1]) calls is $\Omicron(n)$ function.

Consider the following function $f(x) = \sum_{i = 1}^{g(x)}h(i)$ if $g(x)$ is $\Omicron(x)$ and $h(i)$ is $\Omicron(i^k)$ then $f(x)$ is $\Omicron(x^{k+1})$. Do not have the the formal proof but I think it works like $\int_0^nx^kdx = n^{k+1}/(k+1)$ that is $\int_0^nx^kdx$ is $\Omicron(n^{k+1})$.

Applying this consideration to the call of C(n, [5, 1]) we see that number of calls in this tree is the sum where number of terms is the $\Omicron(n)$ function. Terms are the same $\Omicron(n)$ function with the arguments changing according to the arithmetic progression. Thus we can conclude that $T_2(n)$ is $\Omicron(n^2)$

From the other hand the longest path from the top to a leaf in the tree generated by C(20, [5, 1]) has the length of 1 + length of the C(20, [1]) subtree. But we already know that for C(n, [1]) $S_1(n)$ is $\Omicron(n)$ hence $S_2(n)$ is also $\Omicron(n)$

Applying this reasoning to the C(n, [10, 5, 1]), C(n, [25, 10, 5, 1]) and C(x, [50, 25, 10, 5, 1]) inductively we can conclude that $S_5(n)$ is $\Omicron(n)$ and $T_5(n)$ is $\Omicron(n^5)$.
