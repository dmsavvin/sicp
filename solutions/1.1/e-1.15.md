### Exercise 1.15

The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation $sin(x) \approx x$ if $x$ is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity

$$sin(x) = 3sin\left(\frac{x}{3}\right) - 4sin^3\left(\frac{x}{3}\right)$$

to reduce the size of the argument of $sin$. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered “sufficiently small” if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.) These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:
```
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
    (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
        angle
        (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```
1. How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?

2. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

### Solution

Lets consider the sequence of calling of the p procedure while evaluating (sine 12.15):

    (sine 12.15)
    (p (sine 4.05))
    (p (p (sine 1.35)))
    (p (p (p (sine 0.45))))
    (p (p (p (p (sine 0.15)))))
    (p (p (p (p (p (sine 0.05))))))  <-- angle is less then 0.1
    (p (p (p (p (p 0.05)))))
    (p (p (p (p 0.1495))))
    (p (p (p 0.4351345505)))
    (p (p 0.9758465331678772))
    (p -0.7895631144708228)
    > -0.39980345741334

Thus procedure p is applied 5 times when (sine 12.15) is evaluated.

For arbitrary $n$ procedure p should be called $x$ times and $x$ is such that $\frac{n}{3^x} > 0.1$. Thus $\log_3(n) - x < \log_3(0.1)$ and $x > \log_3(10n)$. So time and space complexity of the algorithm is $\Theta(log(n))$
