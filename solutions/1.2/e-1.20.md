### Exercise 1.20

The process that a procedure generates is of course dependent on the rules used
by the interpreter. As an example, consider the iterative gcd procedure given
above. Suppose we were to interpret this procedure using normal-order
evaluation, as discussed in Section 1.1.5. (The normal-order-evaluation rule
for if is described in Exercise 1.5.) Using the substitution method (for normal
order), illustrate the process generated in evaluating (gcd 206 40) and
indicate the remainder operations that are actually performed. How many
remainder operations are actually performed in the normal-order evaluation of
(gcd 206 40)? In the applicative-order evaluation?

```
(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      a
      (gcd b (remainder a b))))
```

### Solution

Listed bellow are parameters of the calls of the `gcd` procedure while evaluating `(gcd 206 40)`. Expressions for the `a` and `b` are given for the case of the normal order evaluation. `r` is using instead of `remainder`.

1

`a` = 206  
`b` = 40  

`(= b 0)` is `#f`, `b` is 40

reminder operation performed:  
normal order evaluation = 0  
applicative order evaluation = 1 (while evaluating the `b` for the recursive call of the `gcd`)  

2

`a` = 40  
`b` = `(r 206 40)`  

`(= b 0)` is `#f`, `b` is 6

reminder operation performed:  
normal order evaluation = 1 (while evaluating the `b` for the `(= b 0)`)  
applicative order evaluation = 1 (while evaluating the `b` for the recursive call of the `gcd`)  

3

`a` = `(r 206 40)`  
`b` = `(r 40 (r 206 40))`  

`(= b 0)` is `#f`, `b` is `4`

reminder operation performed:  
normal order evaluation = 2 (while evaluating the `b` for the `(= b 0)`)  
applicative order evaluation = 1 (while evaluating the `b` for the recursive call of the `gcd`)  

4

`a` = `(r 40 (r 206 40))`  
`b` = `(r (r 206 40) (r 40 (r 206 40)))`  

`(= b 0)` is `#f`, `b` is `2`

reminder operation performed:  
normal order evaluation = 4 (while evaluating the `b` for the `(= b 0)`)  
applicative order evaluation = 1 (while evaluating the `b` for the recursive call of the `gcd`)  

5

`a` = `(r (r 206 40) (r 40 (r 206 40)))`  
`b` = `(r (r 40 (r 206 40)) (r (r 206 40) (r 40 (r 206 40))))`  

`(= b 0)` is `#t`, `b` is 0, `a` is 2

reminder operation performed:  
normal order evaluation = 7 + 4 (while evaluating the `b` for the `(= b 0)` and `a`)  
applicative order evaluation = 0  

Total number of the reminder operation performed:  
normal order evaluation = 7 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 18  
applicative order evaluation = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
