### Exercise 1.25

Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to a lot of extra work in writing `expmod`. Aer all, she says, since we already know how to compute exponentials, we could have simply wrien
```
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m)) 
```
Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our fast prime tester? Explain.

### Solution

There are two problems with Alyssa's variant of `expmod` procedure:
+ We might need a lot of memory to store the result of `(fast-expt base exp)`.
+ Assumption that multiplication time does not depend on the size of the multipliers does not valid for large ints which leads to increase in the complexity of the `expmode`. In the original algorithm multipliers are also grow but much slower (they are no more then `m` while here we should square base^(m/2)).
